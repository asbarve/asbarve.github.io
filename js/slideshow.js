    <p style="text-align:left;">This project, supported by USAID, the Indonesian Federal Emergency Management Agency and in collaboration with the Pacific Disaster Centre, allows residents to share vital flood information using social messaging apps. Confirmed flood reports are added to a publically available map helping to inform communities and emergency agencies of the flood situation in real-time. Currently operating in three cities, Greater Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, the flood map feeds the crowdsourced data to Federal Agency disaster system through a custom built REM (Risk Evaluation Metrix).</p>
